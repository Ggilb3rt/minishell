#include "exec.h"

/* external functions that we may use :
 * - int execve(const char *pathname, char *const argv[], char *const envp[]) : executes the program referred to by
 * pathname. This causes the program that is currently being run by the calling process to be replaced with a new
 * program, with newly initialized stack, heap, and (initialized and uninitialized) data segments.
 * 'pathname' must be either a binary executable, or a script starting with a line of the form :
 * 		#!interpetrer (in our case /bin/sh)
 * 'argv' is an array of pointers to strings passed to the new program as its command-line arguments. By convention,
 * the first of these strings should contain the filename associated with the file being executed. The 'argv' array
 * must be terminted by a NULL pointer.
 * 'envp' is an arry of pointers to strings, conventionally of the form key=value, which are passed as the
 * environment of the new program. The 'envp' array must be terminated by a NULL pointer.
 * The argument vector and environment can be accessed by the new program's main function, when it is defined as:
 * 		int main(int argc, char *argv[], char *envp[])
